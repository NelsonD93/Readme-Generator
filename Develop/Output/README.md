  ## Description
  THis sample is to show the functionality of my command-line based application using node.js
  
  ## Installation
  Simply clone the repo to your local and run 'node index.js' without the quotes. You will need to use npm install Inquirer in order to install the dependency.

  ## Usage
  To automate readme generation for developers

  ## Contributing
  For any contributions, please reach out to my email listed below.

  ## Tests
  Just use the command-line to generate the markdown. The generateMarkdown file has a function of the same name that does most of the rendering of content.
