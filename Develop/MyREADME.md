  ## Description
  This command-line applicaiton was developed to enable developers to generate a readme file by simply answering a handful of questions via user-input. This will then create a dynamic readme file for them to use. Below you will find sections covering installation, contributions, and more. 
  
  ## Installation
  In order to generate your readme, clone the repo down to your local. From there, run npm install in order to install the dependency listed in package.json, Inquirer. To begin using the application, input 'node index.js' into the command-line without the quotes. Answer all prompts and you will have your readme!

  ## Usage
  My application will be used with node.js in order to generate a dynamic readme. 

  ## Contributing
  For any contributions to this, please feel free to reach out to me at my email below.

  ## Tests
  Simply use the application and try different things. The generateMarkdown function in the generateMarkdown.js file is responsible for rendering the actual content.
